- âœ‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WileECoder, the twin brother of [Wile E. Coyote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner).
In our family failure has never been an issue and has never prevented us to go on. Our nature is to try, not to succeed.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in free and open source software, expecially for Linux.
